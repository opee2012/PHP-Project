# CSCI297-project-opee2012

This program will calculate your remaining balance for the month. It starts by having the user entering in last month's
balance, and then it goes to subsequent pages to enter in income sources and expenditures. Afterwards it displays their
remaining balance.

Instructions:

Start the server using `php -S localhost:8080` from the root of the repo.  Use your browser to goto [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
